	<h3 style="color:#ba9e00;"> Hey there! </h3>
	<p style="color:#ba9e00;">My name is Naholin Rodriguez, a rising senior who does not know what to do with her life yet. I live with my parents, my older sister, and our beloved dog Towee. I am currently learning how to code, but most of the time you will find me in my room drawing and listening to music. </p>
	
	<p style="color:#ba9e00;"><b>Likes:</b> Cartoons, comics, music, and drawing. There is not a day where I have not drawn even a scribble.</p>
	<p style="color:#ba9e00;"><b>Dislikes:</b> Spiders, technically they are good and does not attack unless provoked, but stil...too tiny...too many legs...too many eyes</p>
	
	<h3 style="color:#ba9e00;"> Favorite websites </h3>
	<a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/" style="color:#00baa1;"> Webtoons, I want to publish my comics there! </a>
	<p>  </p>
	<a href="https://www.tumblr.com/" style="color:#00baa1;"> Tumblr, regrettably </a>

	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/" style="color:#00baa1;"> I watch Youtube more than I watch TV </a>
	<p>  </p>
	<h3 style="color:#ba9e00;"> Recent projects </h3>
	<p style="color:#ba9e00;"> I am currently working on a comic, Dancing with Death, a love story about an assassin and a ballerina! (It, gets much weirder than you expect)</p>
	<p style="color:#ba9e00;">My two other comics are Darkness before Dawn and Puzzle Pieces</p>
	<p style="color:#ba9e00;">Darkness before Dawn is a fantasy story that is currently on hold, due to me having writers/artists block</p>
	<p style="color:#ba9e00;" >Puzzle Pieces is simply a comic about me and my friends that I do in my free time, which is rare.</p>
